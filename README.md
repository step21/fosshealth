# FossFind

## Discover healthy FOSS communities in Web3
FossFind lets developers contribute to FOSS communities with greater impact. 

FOSS Find builds further upon several pre-existing metrics, with the aim to achieve the highest possible quality data- driven insights. Also, automate the dataset that shows a sort of "Leaderboard" of FOSS projects, allows for filtering/weighting of metrics, and takes in new data with a scraper or other data input method automatically.

## How it Works
Project data is scrapped from Git repositories and curated into a table for easy comparision.
